- Yes, I had it out on the right day → Continue to step 4
- No, I missed the delay → Show message: "That's likely why your trash wasn't picked up. Your next regular pickup will be [date]. Would you like us to return this week for a $25 fee?" with options to pay or wait.

**If near a holiday with NORMAL pickup:**
Show message: "We operated on a normal schedule for [Holiday Name]. Did you have your cart out by 6:30 AM?"

- No → Show return trip options

**If NOT near any holiday:**
Show: "Was your cart at the curb by 6:30 AM?"
