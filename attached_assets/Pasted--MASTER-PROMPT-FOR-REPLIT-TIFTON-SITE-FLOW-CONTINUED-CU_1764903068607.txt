**MASTER PROMPT FOR REPLIT - TIFTON SITE FLOW (CONTINUED):**

---

## CURRENT STATE (from Replit)

You have 28 pages built. Now we need to:
1. Fix the flow between pages
2. Add address lookup routing
3. Clarify service areas on each page
4. Ensure cross-linking works
5. Add residential content to `/tifton` main page (help guide, not separate page)
