Your pickup day depends on your location and service type. Log in to your My Account portal to view your schedule, or contact your local office. New customers receive their pickup day during service setup.

**What time should I have my cart out?**
Place your cart at the curb by 6:00 AM on your scheduled pickup day. Drivers may arrive at any time during the day, and carts placed out late may be missed.

**What if my trash wasn't picked up?**
If your trash wasn't collected on your scheduled day, first verify it was a regular pickup day (not a holiday). Then contact our customer service team to report the missed pickup. We'll work to resolve the issue promptly.
