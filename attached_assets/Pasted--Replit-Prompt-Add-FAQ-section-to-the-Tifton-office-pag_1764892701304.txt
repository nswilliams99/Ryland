**H1:** What Time Does the Trash Truck Come in Tifton?

**Quick Answer:**
Trash trucks in Tifton begin routes at 6:30 AM. Your cart should be at the curb by 6:00 AM on your scheduled pickup day.

**The Details:**
Ryland Environmental services the City of Tifton under an exclusive residential contract. Pickup times vary depending on where you are on the route - some homes are serviced early morning, others mid-day or afternoon. The only guarantee is that your trash will be collected on your scheduled day, so make sure your cart is out by 6:00 AM.

Routes may run later than usual due to weather, holidays, or heavy volume. If it's past 6:00 PM and your trash hasn't been picked up, report a missed pickup by calling our Tifton office.

**Holiday Delays:**
Pickup is pushed back one day after these holidays:
- New Year's Day
- Memorial Day
- Thanksgiving
- Christmas

If your normal pickup is Wednesday and the holiday falls on Monday, your pickup moves to Thursday that week.

**Pro Tips:**
- Set your cart out the night before if you leave for work early
- Wheels against the curb, handle facing your house
- Keep 3 feet of space between your trash and recycling carts
- Don't block mailboxes, fire hydrants, or parked cars
